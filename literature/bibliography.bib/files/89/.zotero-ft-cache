nRF52840 System on Chip
Advanced Bluetooth 5, Thread and Zigbee multiprotocol SoC

The nRF52840 SoC is the most advanced member of the nRF52 Series SoC family. It meets the challenges of sophisticated applications that need protocol concurrency and a rich and varied set of peripherals and features.  It offers generous memory availability for both Flash and RAM, which are prerequisites for such demanding applications.

The nRF52840 is fully multiprotocol capable with full protocol concurrency. It has protocol support for Bluetooth 5, Bluetooth mesh, Thread, Zigbee, 802.15.4, ANT and 2.4 GHz proprietary stacks.

The nRF52840 is built around the 32-bit ARM® Cortex™-M4 CPU with floating point unit running at 64 MHz. It has NFC-A Tag for use in simplified pairing and payment solutions. The ARM TrustZone® CryptoCell cryptographic unit is included on-chip and brings an extensive range of cryptographic options that execute highly efficiently independent of the CPU. It has numerous digital peripherals and interfaces such as high speed SPI and QSPI for interfacing to external flash and displays, PDM and I 2 S for digital microphones and audio, and a full speed USB device for data transfer and power supply for battery recharging.

Exceptionally low energy consumption is achieved using a sophisticated on-chip adaptive power management system.
